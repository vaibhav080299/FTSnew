							Vaibhav:<br>	
<p>An adventure fanatic  with a deep penchant  for reading , writing ,   country and indie pop music.  When not drenching  in music, she can be found relaxing  with her friends, family and pets.<br> She has grown up listening to classic bands like Linkin Park, Maroon Five, Green Day, Guns n Roses, The Beatles, to name a few. 'OLD is GOLD',  is what she swears by but firmly believes that some contemporary  artists are equally worth listening to. <br>She truly believes that music has got no language barriers as she is still hooked on  to Despacito.</p>
